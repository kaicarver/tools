<p>The rest is just formatting, which is tedious to do. I could use Markdown to make typing easier (though I hate typing links in Markdown, I know, I'm petty). But I want something a bit fancier as the final result, which could advantageously be rendered dynamically. And server-side rendered too. So using React or Svelte becomes necessary... It feels like a heavy solution, but server-side plus possible hydration really does everything I want, except to make my developer UX to be optimal, this needs to feel super easy... And I don't have time to look into doing this right now.</p>
