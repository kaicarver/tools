<p>This is a good example of a page that would be more nicely made dynamic. The information is just a list of items containing:</p>

  Jeremy Howard lectures
    https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=2
    fastaivideo
  "fastbook" channel of Slack group where discussion occurs (preferred to Zoom chat)

<p>The rest is just formatting, which is tedious to do. I could use Markdown to make typing easier (though I hate typing links in Markdown, I know, I'm petty). But I want something a bit fancier as the final result, which could advantageously be rendered dynamically. And server-side rendered too. So using React or Svelte becomes necessary... It feels like a heavy solution, but server-side plus possible hydration really does everything I want, except to make my developer UX to be optimal, this needs to feel super easy... And I don't have time to look into doing this right now.</p>
<p>One problem is that, though it doesn't reopen a tab, it does reload what's in it. It should check if the tab is open, and if it is, just put that tab in the foreground. Not sure I can do that with standard web... It's looking more like something more for an extension... But I didn't want to do an extension, this has to run everywhere, on all devices and all browsers!...</p>
